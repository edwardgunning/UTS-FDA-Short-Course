# Welcome

This is the web page for the workshop **"Functional Data Analysis in Sports Biomechanics"**, delivered by [Dr. Edward Gunning (University of Pennsylvania)](https://edwardgunning.github.io/) at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) on the 21st of November 2024.

# üñ• Computing Pre-requisites

## R and RStudio

You should bring your own laptop with the following software installed:

* **The R Language for Statistical Computing**
  * It can be downloaded from [https://cloud.r-project.org](https://cloud.r-project.org)
  * For further assistance see [this video by RStudio education](https://vimeo.com/203516510)

* **The RStudio Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**
  * It can be downloaded from [https://posit.co/](https://posit.co/)
  * For further assistance see [this video by RStudio education](https://vimeo.com/203516510) (**Note**: The RStudio company has changed to Posit PBC, so there may be some minor differences)


**Note**: If you are unable to install R and RStudio, you can work with a free, lite web version of RStudio called [*posit cloud*](https://posit.cloud/). Watch [this video from Posit PBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fzwm4ZhVQQ) to set up an account and get started.

We also recommend setting up an RStudio project to work and store your files for this workshop in -- see [this helpful guide on setting up projects by Posit PBC](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects).

**IMPORTANT**: **We do not require any previous knowledge of R programming or FDA**. We have structured the lecture and practical sessions in such a way that all levels of experience will be catered for. However, if interested, our favourite (free!) resources for getting up to speed with R are:

* [R for Data Science (2nd Edition)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham, Mine √áetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund.

* [R Programming for Data Science](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/) by Roger D. Peng.

## R Packages

For this workshop, we will primarily use the `fda` (Ramsay, Graves and  Hooker, 2024) and `refund` (Goldsmith et al., 2024) packages.

To install these, you should run the following commands:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("fda") # install the fda package
install.packages("refund") # install the refund package
```
